 <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
HTML: Markup structure for the clock interface.<br>
CSS: Styling for responsive design and visual effects.<br>
JavaScript: Logic for time calculations and dynamic updates.

## Project Structure
|-- index.html       # Main HTML file <br>
|-- style.css        # CSS for styling the clock <br>
|-- app.js           # JavaScript for clock functionality


## How It Works
#### Initialization:
The initialClock function runs on page load, setting up the clock. <br>
Updates are handled every second using setInterval.
#### Time and Date Logic:
The current time and date are fetched using JavaScript's Date object. <br>
Adjustments for AM/PM and formatting ensure accurate display.
#### Responsive Styling:
Media queries in CSS adapt font sizes and layout for smaller screens.
